   This blog will primarily have programming topics. I generally make notes
   while I am studying and thought that this would be a good way
   of keeping everything organised. Feel free to explore and suggest any
   code improvements!
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog/
url: "http://yourdomain.com" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
