Counter is a dictionary subclass which helps to count hashable objects like strings. Inside a Counter, elements are stored as dictionary keys and counts are stored as values. These values are allowed to be any integer value including zero or negative counts.

Where can the counter class be used? Suppose we want to maintain the frequencies of each character appearing in a string, we can write the following piece of code:

{% highlight python %}
s     = 'abcdaab'
count = {}
for char in s:
    if char in count:
        count[char] += 1
    else:
        count[char] = 0
{% endhighlight %}

If you know about the working of defaultdict, the following solution can also be implemented to maintain the frequency of characters:

{% highlight python %}
from collections import defaultdict
s     = 'abcdaab'
count = defaultdict(int)
for char in s:
    count[char] += 1
{% endhighlight %}

But instead of doing this manually, Python provides inbuilt support to derive the frequency of elements in a data structure with the counter method of the collections module.

{% highlight python %}
from collections import Counter
s     = 'abcdaab'
count = Counter(s)
{% endhighlight %}


Counter supports three forms of initialization. Its constructor can be called with a **sequence of items**, a **dict containing keys and counts**, or using **keyword arguments** mapping string names to counts.

{% highlight python %}
from collections import Counter
print Counter(['a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'b', 'b']) #Counter({'b': 3, 'a': 2, 'c': 1})
print Counter({'a':2, 'b':3, 'c':1})          #Counter({'b': 3, 'a': 2, 'c': 1})
print Counter(a=2, b=3, c=1)                  #Counter({'b': 3, 'a': 2, 'c': 1})
{% endhighlight %}

An empty Counter can be constructed with no arguments and populated via the **update()** method.

{% highlight python %}
import collections
c = collections.Counter()
print 'Initial :', c        #Counter()
c.update('abcdaab')
print 'Sequence:', c        #Counter({'a': 3, 'b': 2, 'c': 1, 'd': 1})
c.update({'a':1, 'd':5})
print 'Dict    :', c        #Counter({'d': 6, 'a': 4, 'b': 2, 'c': 1})
{% endhighlight %}

As can be seen from the above example, the count values are increased based on the new data, rather than replaced. In this example, the count for a goes from 3 to 4.

Once the counter has been populated, the values can be accessed just like we access elements from a dictionary. If a key does not exist in the counter, it's **default value is set to 0**.

{% highlight python %}
import collections
c = collections.Counter('abcdaab')
for letter in 'abcde':
    print '%s : %d' % (letter, c[letter])

Output:
a : 3
b : 2
c : 1
d : 1
e : 0
{% endhighlight %}

The counter class has two commonly used methods:

  - **elements()**: The elements() method returns an iterator that produces all of the items known to the Counter.

{% highlight python %}
import collections
c = collections.Counter('extremely')
print c                     #Counter({'e': 3, 'm': 1, 'l': 1, 'r': 1, 't': 1, 'y': 1, 'x': 1})
print list(c.elements())    #['e', 'e', 'e', 'm', 'l', 'r', 't', 'y', 'x']
{% endhighlight %}

- **most_common()**: The most_common() method is used to return the 'n' most commonly occuring characters and their frequencies where 'n' is a parameter to the most_common() method

{% highlight python %}
import collections
c = collections.Counter('extremely')
print c                                #Counter({'e': 3, 'm': 1, 'l': 1, 'r': 1, 't': 1, 'y': 1, 'x': 1})
for letter, count in c.most_common(1): 
    print '%s: %d' % (letter, count)   #e 3
{% endhighlight %}


PS- The Counter class is similar to bags or multisets in other languages. We will get to this at some point of time in the future.
